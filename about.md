<h2>About Sarah Albrecht</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nCRigQLndk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
I'm a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill studying Information Science! I live in 
Charlotte, North Carolina, but I grew up on Long Island, New York. When I'm not
crying over Amazon Prime commercials with dogs in them I'm sleeping, cooking, or
playing Super Smash Bros with my bros. I have a very weak spot for animals, 
especially birds, dogs, and cats.
