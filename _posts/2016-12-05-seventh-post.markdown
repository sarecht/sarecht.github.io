For the sixth and final project in INLS 161, we worked in pairs to create a
presentation that would educate our class and utilize the skills we gained
throughout the semester. I worked with Emma Caison and we chose to present on
3D printing prosthetics. This is a topic we are both interested in, so we decided
to attend a 3D printing information session at the Kenan Science Library to find out
some basic information on the process. We both took notes and decided to do
some more research on our own separately. 
The starting instructions were fairly simple and we didn't have any issues following
them. We typed out our "script" in our markdown file and once that was done we
thought that the bulk of the work for the project was done. We were very wrong.
We met up to record our audio on Emma' MacBook. Because Audacity wasn't working
and we were both afraid to download the Ogg Vorbis software, we recorded our
script in GarageBand and hoped that Cloud9 would accept our files as MP3s instead
of .ogg files.  That was our first challenge.
Another challenge we faced that night was that our pictures weren't showing up
in our presentation. We tried to remove the block text marker of ``` from our 
markdown file but it wasn't enough. We ended up emailing Elliott about it because 
we were frustrated and we found out that the combination of the ``` marker and our
picture text being indented resulted in the pictures not showing up.
On the last work day in class we spent a long, long time trying to understand how
and where to put our audio files in our code. We kept putting them in out index.html
file, but it kept deleting our changes every time and we caught on after probably
way too many tries. Once our audio finally worked we were so happy! And then we
listened to our project all the way through and realize that our audio sounded awful
and was rather sloppily done. We decided to change the theme of our presentation to
the Sky theme and then we rented a microphone during class and went off to
rerecord our audio, which should have been the last step for us. Instead, Emma's 
MacBook's driver wouldn't recognize the microphone and we spent the rest of the 
class trying to figure out what was wrong. We ended up asking the SILS help desk
for assistance and luckily enough the assistant solved the problem for us by
restarting Emma's computer. In the end we were able to record our new audio and 
put it in our presentation, but we did a lot of work to get there!
This project was certainly challenging, but I feel like everything else we had done
in class prepared me for it. This class helped me to develop a better problem solving
attitude because it helped me learn that when things didn't run properly it wasn't
the end of the world. I actually wanted to solve the problems that came up and I
liked working with Emma so that we could talk through the problems together.
I probably wouldn't have gotten through the project alone so I appreciated having
a partner to consult.
The motivation to problem solve that this class and project have taught me is an
important skill that I will definitely use in future SILS classes and in whatever
job I have. I really enjoyed this project and I'm proud of my (and Emma's) work!
