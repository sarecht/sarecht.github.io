Last Monday I went to a 3D printing information session at the Kenan Science Library.
This information session is offered regularly throughout the academic year at UNC
and I decided to go so that I could do my final assignment on 3D printing.

During this session one of the librarians that knew about 3D printing talked through
the basics of 3D printing such as the sources for 3D models, the type of digital
file used by the printer, types of materials, and important design considerations.
One can obtain 3D models from online model repositories, 3D scanning, converting from
other 3D formats, and 3D design programs. 

Even past picking a model there are many different considerations for printing 
a 3D object. Design considerations such as making parts fit and deciding how to
make an object structurally sound are extremely important in 3D printing. The librarian
explained that infill and inner supports can be used in objects that need it. Some 3D
printers have soluble infill. After an object is printed, you would soak it in a
special solution to dissolve the unnecessary filament. 

After this session I got to look around the 3D printing workshops in the library and see
what people at UNC have built. This was perhaps the most interesting part of my
experience because it showed me how versatile and flexible 3D printing is. I saw
prints of the Old Well and prints of bats and dragons. These objects were really
amazing to see, and I even got to see 3D printers in action.

Overall this session provided me with a lot of insight with 3D printing. I found the information
about 3D models to be particularly enlightening because even though I assumed a lot
of thought and work goes into building 3D models I didn't understand where that
work was going specifically. It also provided me with information on 3D printing resources
on campus. For example, if I wanted to have an object 3D printed I could get 300 grams
printed for free as a student and librarians would help me choose and tweak a model to make
it work. If I was interesting in actually printing an object I would have to attend a series
of safety workshops and classes to learn how to use the printers. 

This session was a valuable experience for me and I recommend it for anyone that is interested
in 3D printing.
