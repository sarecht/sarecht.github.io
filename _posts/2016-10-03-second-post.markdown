I joined UNC's Cybersecurity Club and it's going exactly how I thought it would:
I'm very confused and the other members are very good with computers already.

For the first hands on activity, we made accounts on 
<a href=" ">https://www.hackthissite.org/</a>. This site provides users with 
fake tasks to complete in order to test and establish "hacking" skills when it
comes to cybersecurity. 

The first task we did was a beginner "real life" task where we were supposed to
find the secret log in page for a white supremist group's website so we could
ruin their method of communication. This involved looking at the HTML of the 
website and finding a secret element that showed up in the HTML, but not on the 
page itself. I was able to nagivagate through the HTML pretty well and 
understand what everything meant. Someone else in my group solved this part first
and we moved on to the next step, which was the hardest part. We had to find a 
way to log in as a member without actually having a username or password for the
website. It didn't just involve guessing, either: the goal was to trick the 
website into thinking whatever you wrote was valid as a username and password.
