For assignment 5 we worked in groups again to modify our script so that it
stored answers from users in a MySql database. This was a pretty difficult
task and involved a lot of Google-ing. I'm really glad we got to work in groups
for this assignment because talking challenged through with my group members
definitely made this task easier to figure out. 

In particular, my group had issues with loading the data from a csv file into MySql
because the data kept douplicating itself so that there were many repeats. I think
this problem probably took well over an hour to solve in total, but after browsing
StackOverflow and asking Elliot many questions we were able to get our script to
work.

Ellen and I stayed over an hour after class on Wednesday night to finish the project
and solve the problem of duplicating data. When we ran our script for the last time without
any errors we were both so happy and excited. It was a great feeling to work
through a difficult problem as a team until it was solved.
Another challenge we faced was the problem of a password when running MySql from the
bash command line. In the end we removed the password requirement which made the
actual password blank. This was good because then the use just has to hit enter.
I'm sure there is a smoother way to do this without requiring input from the user,
but this is the best we could come up with for now and I'm still proud we solved
that problem. It helped me see how flexible the command line is.

Overall I enjoyed this project. It was much more difficult than our other assignments, but that
meant that the final result was more satisfying.
