For assignment 4, we worked in groups of three to write a script that asks for and
accepts data and then stores the data in a CSV file. This was an extension of what
we had previously learned with scripting.
I worked with Ellen and Sanjana. When we worked on the assignment in class on
the first day we were able to get pretty far. We named our script octocat after the cute GitHub mascot. I created the workspace and we
figured out how to share it with our group so we could collaborate. 
Our main issue had to do with working collaboratively on cloud9. We learned the frustrating way that one has to
push and pull individually to get the most up-to-date version of a workspace
after each person makes an edit. I'm sure we were all used to the type of instantenous
updating system that Google Docs uses, so this was an adjustment for us. We worked
through it though and after this we had few issues.
We wrote a cute script with cute questions that UNC students can answer. My group
worked well together and I found being in a group to be helpful because each person
has their own set of knowledge to bring to the project.
