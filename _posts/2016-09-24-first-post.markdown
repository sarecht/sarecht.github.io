So far in INLS 161 we have learned about many things I've never even heard of
before, starting with Github and Cloud 9. It's been difficult to learn how to 
use them, but repeating the commands over and over again helps me learn. For 
example, after creating multiple disposable Cloud 9 workspaces I finally learned
that 


cd


is the command to move around files in a directory and


pwd 


is how to find out where you are. I think this class is really interesting so
far and I'm definitely interested in learning about HTML!
