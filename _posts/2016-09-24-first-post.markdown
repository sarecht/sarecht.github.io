So far in INLS 161 we have learned about many things I've never even heard of
before, starting with Github and Cloud 9. It's been difficult to learn how to 
use them, but repeating the commands over and over again helps me learn. For 
example, after creating multiple disposable Cloud 9 workspaces I finally learned
that 

{% highlight html %}
 cd 
{% endhighlight %}

is the command to move around files in a directory and

{% highlight html %}
pwd 
{% endhighlight html %}

is how to find out where you are.  One of the harder commands to remember is the
one that runs a Jekyll server for you to test the changes to your website on.
This command is

{% highlight html %}
jekyll serve --host $IP --port $PORT
{% endhighlight %}

All of what we do in this class nears to be learned through practicing, and I 
like that a lot more than studying and having to memorize things without an 
application. Everything we learn has been practical so far and I hope that I 
have a chance to use what I gain from this class in the future!

I'm looking forward to the final project for this class which will be a 
multimedia presentation. It will stand in for a final exam, which I'm excited 
about. It'll be more efficient to actually show what I've learned rather than to
write about it.
